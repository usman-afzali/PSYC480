### About Me (The Project Leader)

Hello/Salaam/Kia ora. I am Usman Afzali - a research fellow at University of Canterbury. I completed my PhD in psychology and am currently the principal investigator (project leader) of the three-year [New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study.html) (NZAVS) Flourishing Project (started 2023).

Beside research work, I teach two courses, [Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC480&occurrence=23S1(C)&year=2023) and [Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC344&occurrence=22S2(C)&year=2022), in the School of Psychology at University of Canterbury. I have supervised research and am willing to take on students.

In my spare time, I learn programming - especially I like to write `R` code for the courses I teach.

My CV, publications, and further information can be found on my [website](www.usmanafzali.com).
