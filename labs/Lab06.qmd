# Recap {background-color="orange"}

## Processing {background-color="#346bc8"}

-   Referencing and filtering
-   Removing unwanted channels
-   Removing artefacts
-   ICA

## Microstates {background-color="#346bc8"}

-   Differences between Windows and Mac versions
-   What else is needed for microstates analysis?

## Group level analysis {background-color="#346bc8"}

::: incremental

-   Use `Lab 6 demo` dataset on Learn.
-   Let's process according to the pipeline!
-   Watch Delorme's [video](https://eeglab.org/tutorials/10_Group_analysis/multiple_subject_proccessing_overview.html) for a comprehensive tutorial.

##  Group level analysis continued {background-color="#346bc8"}

::: incremental
-   Remove non-EEG channels
-   Compute average reference
-   Use ASR: by removing channel drift around 1 (0.75 and 1.25), recommended for ICA. Change the the minimum correlation to 0.7.
-   Reference 2-20 for microstates
-   Average reference again, and interpolate removed channel(s).
-   Run ICA (with Picard) and the rest of the processing.
-   Get average microstates (for both sets together).

##  Group level microstates {background-color="#346bc8"}

Should look similar to this figure.

## To submit {background-color=#346bc8}

-   Use the the `Lab 6 exercise` dataset on Learn.
-   Conduct pre-processing.
-   Write the steps of pre-processing taken.
-   Share the first screenshot (before any processing) and the final screenshot (post processing).
