Whakataka te hau ki te uru/
Whakataka te hau ki te tonga/
Kia mākinakina ki uta/
Kia mātaratara ki tai/
E hī ake ana te atakura/
He tio, he huka, he hau hū/
Tīhei mauri ora!

Cease the winds from the west/
Cease the winds from the south/
Let the breeze blow over the land/
Let the breeze blow over the ocean/
Let the red-tipped dawn come with a sharpened air./
A touch of frost, a promise of a glorious day.
