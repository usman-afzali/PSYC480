Whakataka te hau ki te uru/
Whakataka te hau ki te tonga/
Kia mākinakina ki uta/
Kia mātaratara ki tai/
E hī ake ana te atakura/
He tio, he huka, he hau hū/
Tīhei mauri ora!

Cease the winds from the west/
Cease the winds from the south/
Let the breeze blow over the land/
Let the breeze blow over the ocean/
Let the red-tipped dawn come with a sharpened air./
A touch of frost, a promise of a glorious day.

## Assessments {background-color=#346bc8}

| Assessment | Due | % of final mark |
|---------|:-----|------:|
| Written labs      | Due Fridays   |    20%  |
| Class participation    | During lectures  |   10% |
| Lit Review/Essay      | 17 Mar   |     10%  |
| Oral group presentation | Week 10 (15 May) | 20% |
| Lab Report | 2 Jun | 40% |

## Class Participation 10% {background-color=#346bc8}

During 7 out of 8 weeks (excluding weeks 3, 4, , 10, and 12), you will be required to contribute to class discussions. The quality of your contribution will be noted during classes. If you contribute meaningfully to at least 7 discussions, you will get a full 10% class contribution mark.

## Class Participation {background-color=#346bc8}

![](/figs/classParticipation.png)

## Written Labs 20% {background-color=#346bc8}

This course has 10 one-hour labs, in the first 10 weeks. Eight labs deal with processing and analyzing EEG data and you will be required to submit written work by the end of these weeks. Two labs (Lab 7 and Lab 10) do not require any written work. Lab 7 deals with collecting data from each of you, using EEG headset, that you will process and analyze for your Individual Lab Report assignment. Lab 10 teaches you how to write a lab report. Each lab contributes 2% to your final PSYC480 grades (=20% total from labs). Please note that you cannot write the Individual Lab Report unless you have your own EEG data. This being the case, Lab 7 is also important for your 40% Individual Lab Report.

## Written Labs {background-color=#346bc8}

![](/figs/writtenLabs.png)


## Literature Review/Essay 10% {background-color=#346bc8}

A 1000 word (3 pages) literature review/essay covering fundamentals of and methods in neuroscience. This exercise will help you dig deeper into the world of neuroscience and having a think about what processes and methods you might use in case you wanted to conduct neuroscientific research. You can select from variety of topics, including but not limited to the history of neuroscience, old methods, contemporary methods, the role of advanced computational modelling, the role of open-science in improving neuroscientific research, the role of online repository and version control tools such as Git and GitHub, etc.
