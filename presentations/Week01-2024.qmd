## Assessments {background-color=#346bc8}

| Assessment | Due | % of final mark |
|---------|:-----|------:|
| Written labs      | Due Fridays   |    15%  |
| Class participation    | During lectures  |   15% |
| Lit Review/Essay      | 28 Mar   |     35%  |
| Oral group presentation | Weeks 11 and 12 (22 and 29 May) | 20% |
| Lab Report | 14 Jun | 15% |

## Written Labs 15% {background-color=#346bc8}

This course has 5 two-hour labs. 

Four labs deal with processing and analyzing EEG data + MATLAB and you will be required to submit written work by the end of these weeks. Each lab contributes 3.75% to your final PSYC480 grades (=15% total from labs). The final lab (Report Writing) does not require any written work. 

## Written Labs continued {background-color=#346bc8}

The first four weeks are dedicated to data collection, so there are no labs, and you will collect data using EEG headset, that you will process and analyze for your Individual Lab Report assignment. Please note that you cannot write the Individual Lab Report unless you have your own EEG data. This being the case, the first four weeks are important for your 15% Individual Lab Report.

## Written Labs {background-color=#346bc8}

## Class Participation 15% {background-color=#346bc8}

During 6 out of 7 weeks (excluding weeks 3, 4, 8, 11, and 12), you will be required to contribute to class discussions. The quality of your contribution will be noted during classes. If you contribute meaningfully to at least 6 discussions, you will get a full 15% class contribution mark.

## Class Participation {background-color=#346bc8}

![](/figs/class-participation-.png)

## Literature Review/Essay 35% {background-color=#346bc8}

By the end of Week 6, you will be required to submit a 2000 word literature review/essay covering fundamentals of neuroscience, methods in neuroscience, and applications in contemplative sciences. This exercise will help you dig deeper into the world of contemplation, neuroscience and having a think about what processes and methods you might use in case you wanted to conduct neuroscientific research. You can select from a variety of topics, including but not limited to the history of neuroscience, old methods, contemporary methods, the role of advanced computational modelling, the role of open-science in improving neuroscientific research, the role of online repository.... 

## Literature Review/Essay {background-color=#346bc8}

....and version control tools such as Git and GitHub, etc. Don't worry. These will be covered in the first two weeks of the course, and a lot of literature on contemplative science will also be made available.

## Oral Group Presentation 20% {background-color=#346bc8}

::: incremental

-   Prepare a talk individually or as part of a group of two - depending upon the breadth of the topic.
-   Although you can present as part of a group, each of you will get their own grade.
-   Select a topic from Week 5-7 or 9-10. The readings will be added soon.
-   Each person should take only 7.5 mins. If you are presenting as part of the group, the two of you will present one after another for 15 mins. If you exceed your allocated time, you will have your presentation terminated at the end of the allocated period.

## Oral Group Presentation continued {background-color=#346bc8}

::: incremental

-   These presentations happen during Weeks 11 and 12 at the class time 9:00am - 12:00 noon. Chances are that these might get a bit longer, so be prepared.
-   Use Google Scholar, PsycInfo, UC Library and other relevant databases to update and extend your readings. The whole class will gain more from a presentation if everyone is prepared. When preparing a topic, you may arrange to discuss your proposed presentation with Usman beforehand.
