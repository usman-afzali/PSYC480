    "text": "PSYC480 is a one semester 15-point (0.1250 EFT) course aimed at postgraduate students who are interested in gaining skills in computational neuroscience. As neuroscience knowledge grows in its scope of societal applications, so does the need to educate a wider audience on how to critically evaluate its research findings. Recent years have seen numerous initiatives to reach a wider university population by making neuroscience more interdisciplinary, integrative, accessible and applicable to students’ lives and intrinsic interests. In addition, we see an increasing global trend in adopting embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended research of cognitive processes (also known as the 4E approach), rather than sufficing with behavioural-only lab studies. The focus of the course will be to apply computational neuroscience techniques to the emerging field of research that aims to understand changes within the mind, brain, and body as a result of contemplative practices, such as mindfulness-based meditation, contemplative walking, or yoga. More broadly, practices where the subjective sense of oneself as an isolated entity can temporarily fade into an experience of unity with other people or one’s surroundings. The course is interdisciplinary and attempts to clarify such mind-brain-body changes across emotional, behavioural, cognitive, and perceptual domains with an emphasis for relating such changes to data obtained with Electroencephalogram (EEG) and analysed with the latest computational techniques. Hence, PSYC480 will also be a step towards adopting the 4E approach to cognition.\nThe goal of this course is to teach computational neuroscience and data science relevant for obtaining neurological data from people using static and portable EEG devices, understand the characteristics of such data sets, develop an understanding of the anatomical structures, physiological, and pathological states of the brain and spinal cord and nerves in various states, and analyse such data sets. At the end of the course, the students will gain an understanding of:\n\nStructure and function of the brain and neurological processes.\nPsychological and mental health attributes that can be understood and analyzed using electrophysiological signals.\nBe able to understand to design and carry out experiments to obtain EEG signals.\nBe able to analyze EEG signals and apply computational tools to derive appropriate statistical measures from brain rhythm data, such as micro-states."

The School of Psychology, Speech and Hearing has a Psychology Staff/Student Liaison Committee and at least five students voluntarily represent postgraduate students for both papers and thesis years for the whole year. A request for volunteers is sent early in the first semester.\nTe Ratonga Whaikaha | Student Accessibility Service\nPlease refer to Te Ratonga Whaikaha | Student Accessibility Service | University of Canterbury for information on study support services.\nTest and Exam Special Arrangements for students registered with TRW | SAS Special arrangements for tests and examinations are generally organised, if required, at the beginning of the academic year, in collaboration with an Accessibility Advisor. Special arrangements have cut-off dates for each exam period, and you must be registered with TRW | SAS in advance if you require this support. While the implementation of special arrangements for exams are automatically arranged by the Examinations Office, you must email examinations@canterbury.ac.nz to organise your special arrangements for tests.\nMana Wānanga | Academic Integrity\nIt is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with the definitions, policies and procedures concerning academic misconduct/dishonest behaviour. Instances of academic misconduct will be dealt with in a serious and appropriate manner. Students should refer to: Academic Integrity | University of Canterbury\nTārua Whānako | Policy on Dishonest Practice\nPlagiarism, collusion, copying and ghost writing are unacceptable and dishonest practices.\n\nPlagiarism is the presentation of any material (text, data, figures or drawings, on any medium including computer files) from any other source without clear and adequate acknowledgement of the source.\nCollusion is the presentation of work performed in conjunction with another person or persons, but submitted as if it has been completed only by the named author(s).\nCopying is the use of material (in any medium, including computer files) produced by another person(s) with or without their knowledge and approval.\nGhost writing is the use of another person(s) (with or without payment) to prepare all or part of an item submitted for assessment.\n\nIn cases where dishonest practice is involved in tests or other work submitted for credit, the student will be referred to the University Proctor. The instructor may choose to not mark the work.\nThe School of Psychology, Speech and Hearing reserves the right to require work to be submitted in electronic format so that it can be submitted to plagiarism detection websites.\nNgā Tōmuringa | Late Work / Penalty\nLab participation and lecture participation are designed to break down learning into ‘digestible’ chunks. As such, participation in labs and lectures are due at the end of their respective weeks; late participation will not be accepted. Late lab reports and individual lab reports will be marked down by 5% of the total score for each day it is late (i.e., reduced by 5% for being 1 day late, 10% for being 2 days late, etc.).\nIf illness or special circumstances prevent you from submitting an assignment on time, this work should be accompanied by a medical certificate and/or a short note explaining why it is late. Days late include weekends and holidays.\nNgā Pairuri Motuhake | Special Consideration\nSpecial Consideration for assessments is for students who have covered the work of a course but have been prevented from demonstrating their knowledge or skills at the time of the assessment due to unforeseen circumstances. Students should consult the Special Considerations website for information: https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/special-consideration/.\nAlso on the Examinations webpage is information about Results and Appeals for final grades. The School of Psychology Speech and Hearing policy of “substantial part of assessment” for all courses is set at 50% of all coursework. Unless a minimum of 50% of coursework is completed, final special consideration will not be given. Additionally, special considerations in the form of aegrotats can only be applied to a maximum of 50% of coursework within a given course.\nA special consideration application is not the process to apply for an extension of time to complete a piece of assessment. You must contact the course coordinator, with your supporting documentation, to apply for an extension of time to complete the assessment. Please note that where possible, an extension of time should be applied for prior to making an application for a special consideration e.g., for essays, literature reviews, or other written or ‘take-home’ assignments.\nTaumata Ako | Marks and Grades\nYou will get a mark and/or a grade for each piece of assessment during the course and a final grade at the end of the course. For more information on the University regulations for credit see: General conditions for credit regulations | General regulations | Regulations | University of Canterbury.\nTe Pīra Taumata | Reconsideration of Grades Students can appeal any decision made on their final grade, and should, in the first instance, speak to the course coordinator about their grade. Students can apply through Student Services to appeal for up to four weeks after the release of results: Result dates and appeals | Study | University of Canterbury.\nFor more information see General Course and Examination Regulations in the University Calendar: https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/publications/brochure-gallery/tabs/study-options/documents/UC-Calendar.pdf\nNgā Ritenga Nawe | Complaints and Grievances If a student encounters any problems regarding any aspect of the course, they should in the first instance approach the lecturer concerned. Failing that, they can approach the course coordinator. For more information, please see the Psychology Handbook.\nTe Matangaro i ngā Whakamātautau | Missed Tests\nIn rare cases a student will not be able to sit a test. In such cases, the student should consult with the course coordinator to discuss if alternative arrangements are available. This must be done well in advance of the set date of the test. The criteria used for approving a special sitting are the same as the UC policy used for end-of-semester examinations, which are outlined below:\n\nClash with another test from other UC courses\nReligious (Conflicting religious day or event)\nBereavement (family member or close friend)\nStudy (overseas study, must be a tertiary institute)\nSporting or cultural event (Representing NZ, Canterbury or the University of Canterbury)\nWedding (immediate family member or part of a bridal party)\nBusiness (travel)\n\nWith the exception of the above criteria, tests will only be given at the regularly scheduled time and place. Missed tests will result in a score of 0% for that test.\nNgā Whakamarumaru | Emergency Preparedness\nPlease refer to this link to familiarise yourself with the information in the event of an emergency situation: Emergency preparedness | University of Canterbury"

Lab 7 deals with collecting data from each of you, using EEG headset, that you will process and analyze for your Individual Lab Report assignment. Lab 10 teaches you how to write a lab report. Each lab contributes 2% to your final PSYC480 grades (=20% total from labs). Please note that you cannot write the Individual Lab Report unless you have your own EEG data.
